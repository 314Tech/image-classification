# image-classification
This is my version of the convolution network from project 2 of the [Udacity Deep Learning class](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). 
# Project Goal
Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. We normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, we see their predictions on the sample images.
